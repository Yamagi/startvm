Simple script to run a Bhvye virtual machine. You need to provide a
system.cfg in the same directory as the script. Before running this
script make sure that the following kernel modules are loaded:
 - if_bridge.ko
 - if_tap.ko
 - nmdm.ko
 - vmm.ko

All instances of this script must share the same configuration dir,
otherwise strange things will happen. To boot other guests beside
FreeBSD the sysutils/grub2-bhyve must be installed.
